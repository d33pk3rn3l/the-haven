# The Haven

Our civilization is digital. Our laws, our culture, our science: it's all data. But it's all stored on a single, fragile planet. Terrestrial [data embassies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_embassy) are a start, but they won't survive a global catastrophe.

> **The ultimate off-site backup cannot be on-site.**

## The Solution: A Planetary Data Network

**The Haven** is a global, multi-layered data network in space, designed to ensure our knowledge and systems survive any terrestrial disaster.

* **LEO Satellites:** A "hot" network for live government operations.
* **GEO Satellites:** A "warm" hub for stable, long-term continuity.
* **Lunar Archive:** A "cold" vault on the Moon for a nation's most vital data.
* **'Eternity' Probes:** An "ultra-cold" archive sent to the stars to preserve our legacy for millennia.

## The Swiss Key: Neutrality as a Service

This global commons needs a neutral guardian. Switzerland provides the **diplomatic and legal key**.

* It spearheads the **international treaty** to create **The Haven**.
* It hosts the **Swiss Neutrality Vault**, the back-up, trusted ground station that provides secure access to the entire space network, protected by Swiss and international law.

**The Haven** is a vision for planetary resilience, initiated by Swiss neutrality, for the benefit of all humanity.

## A note on statehood
The Haven is not a state, but a global commons. It is not bound by the laws of any single nation, but rather governed by one or more international treaties that ensure its neutrality and accessibility to all. It may be operated by a consortium of nations, organizations, or private entities, but its core principles remain: to protect and preserve humanity's digital world for current and future generations.
